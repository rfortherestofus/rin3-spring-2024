# Quarto Exercise {.inverse}

## Quarto Exercise

1. Copy the code from [this Quarto document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-spring-2024/main/misc/no-render.qmd). Figure out why it won't render and change it so that it will!

1. Copy the code from [this second Quarto document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-spring-2024/main/misc/guess-what.qmd). There are a series of questions in it. Tackle them one by one, making changes to the document as you do so.

## How to structure your Quarto documents

1. Load packages at top

1. Import data at top

1. Code chunks used throughout to make outputs (graphs, tables, maps, etc)

1. I also do data cleaning/tidying in a separate R script file (you'll learn about this soon)

## How I use Quarto documents is not how you have to use Quarto documents!

. . .

> All the content about Quarto has been extremely helpful -- and it's also made me realize that I have been using R Markdown differently than intended.

Many people do data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in Quarto documents!

## How to change the size of plots in Quarto documents

```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  count(island) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

## How to change the look and feel of Quarto documents

- Depends on output format

- For HTML, [use a combination of themes and custom CSS](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)

- For Word, use [reference documents](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)

- For PDF, check out [`typst` format](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html)

- There are lessons on each of these later in R in 3 Months!

## How to Make Sense of R Help Docs

> I looked into the geomtextpath package and even found a fairly helpful guide (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geomtextpath/vignettes/geomtextpath.html) but I'm still at a loss on how to incorporate the names into the lines themselves. I wish I were better at understanding the Help guides.
