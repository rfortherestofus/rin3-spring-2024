## David's Top Tidy Data Tips and Example

1. Think about your unit of analysis (e.g. individuals, responses to a question, etc) and tidy your data based on this

1. Breaking your data into multiple data frames is often an important first step

What dplyr filter do you want to write later on?

Data across columns

Something that is multiple variables in single cell

## Tidy Data Question

> When working with "select all that apply" variables in the past in datasets where one row = one individual, I've typically dealt with this by converting each response option to its own column where a 1 ("yes") is present if that response option was selected. This has worked well for my purposes, but I understand now that it violates Tidy Data Rule 1 because a single variable is spread across multiple columns. Am I understanding correctly that while the approach I've used in the paste is not inherently better or worse than tidy format, the advantage to making it tidy is that it will be easier to analyze using tidyverse? Is this still true if the unit of analysis I'm interested in is the individual and not the activity (for example)?

## Code Formatting

Why do I put the assignment operator on the first line and code below it?
